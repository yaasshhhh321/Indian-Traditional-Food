	  <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
	  <h3><li>2.5 to 3 cups Dosa Batter</li>
   <li>½ to ¾ cup onions – finely chopped</li>
    <li>½ to ¾ cup tomatoes – finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 or 2 green chilies – finely chopped</li>
   <li>1 to 2 tablespoon coriander leaves – finely chopped (cilantro), optional</li>
    <li>oil – add as required</li>
    <li>Sambar Powder or pav bhaji masala or idli podi, add as required, optional</li></h3>

      <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
      <h3><li>In a large bowl, add rava/suji (semolina), yogurt, salt, and water.Mix.
Now add ENO.</li> 
<li>Let this batter rest for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>In the meantime, chop onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and green chilies.</li>
<li>Make cilantro chutney – I winged it and added some tadka. I basically made my Cilantro Chutney, added some yogurt, and made a tadka (tempering) of oil, mustard seeds, curry leaves, and dry red chilies.</li> 
<li>I don’t have a recipe for this, just winged it. Of course, you can use store-bought too or also make coconut chutney.
After 20 minutes, your batter will look like this.</li>
<li> The rava absorbs all the water.You need to add more water for a consistency that is still thick, but you can still pour.</li>
<li> Add 2 tbsp of water at a time and keep adding water until you have a pouring consistency, but is still thick. I will estimate you will need roughly 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of water – but start with less.</li>
<li>This is what you should have</li>
