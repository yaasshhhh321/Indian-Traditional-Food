      <p><h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
      <h3><li>1 cup blanched chana dal</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon ghee</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon refined oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon powdered green cardamom</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon nutmeg powder</li>
      <li>1/4 cup wate</h3></li>



      <p><h1>Step 1: Prepare the Stuffing for the Puran Poli</h1>
<h3><li> Rinse the chana dal well and cook it in a pressure cooker with the water for 6 to 7 whistles. The chana dal should be soft but 
not mushy.</li> 
<li>Once cooked, strain the water carefully and keep the chana dal aside.</li>
<li>Heat some ghee in the frying pan or kadai. Add the spices like ginger powder, cardamom powder, nutmeg powder, and fennel powder to the ghee. You can skip the ginger powder for making Bobbatlu.</li>
<li>Stir the spices only for a few seconds.</li>
<li>Add the boiled chana dal and jaggery.</li>
<li>Mix well and let it cook. Do stir in between and keep the heat medium-low so the mixture does not stick to the pan.</li>
<li>Once the mixture is dry, turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Use a potato masher to mash the chana dal mixture very well.</li>
<li>Let it cool down, and start working on the dough!</h3></li>


<p><h1>This step of the Puran Poli recipe is quite easy!</h1>
<h3><li>Take a mixture bowl. Put the whole wheat flour and the all-purpose flour. Here, you can use only wheat flour if you want to make Andhra-style Bobbatlu or only all-purpose flour if you want to make Obbattu or Holige, as they are made in Karnataka.</li> 
<li>Add the salt and turmeric and give it a good mix. The turmeric adds a nice yellow colour to the Puran Poli. However, Bobbatlu does not have any turmeric.</li>
<li>Pour in the ghee.</li>
<li>Start kneading and keep adding water as needed. You will need a smooth and soft dough. Allow it to rest for 15 to 20 minutes.</h3></li> 


<p><h1>The dough and the stuffing are ready. You can start making the Puran Polis.</h1>
<h3><li>Divide the dough into 12 balls. Feel free to make the polis bigger or smaller as you like. We suggest you make the dough balls medium to large and not small so you can stuff them well.</li> 
<li>Roll out each ball into small flatbreads or spread them with your hand.</li> 
<li>Keep a good amount of Puran mixture in the middle of the dough. Join and pinch the edges.</li>  
<li>Carefully roll the stuffed dough balls into flatbreads. Dust the rolling pin with some flour for easy rolling.</li>  
<li>Meanwhile, heat a tawa or griddle.</li>  
<li>Add some ghee. You can opt for oil, but ghee will give a richer taste</li> . 
<li>Place the Puran Poli on the pan. Leave for some seconds and turn when one side gets a slight golden crust. Cook the Puran Poli on both sides until it gets a nice golden brown colour. Press them down gently with a spatula so all sides puff nicely, and brush or apply a bit of ghee as needed.</li>  
<li>Place a kitchen napkin or parchment paper at the bottom of a casserole or bread basket and stack the Puran Polis on each other. The napkin will prevent the Puran Poli at the bottom from sagging.</li></h3></p>


<p><h1>Step 4: Serve the Puran Poli</h1>
<h3>Puran Polis tastes the best when hot. You get a bit of crunch from the browning spots on the flatbread, and the stuffing inside is soft and syrupy. You can serve Puran Poli as it is. Or else, pair it with some curd, milk, or luscious aamras!</h3>

<h3>Here are some pro tips when you try this Puran Poli recipe!</h3>
<h3><li>Soak the chana dal for 30 minutes before putting it on the heat to lessen the cooking time. If you haven’t soaked the dal beforehand, you can soak the dal and prepare the dough. When the dough is ready, the dal will be soaked well.</li>  
<li>Start making the stuffing as the dough rests.</li>
<li>It’s okay if the Puran Poli tears a bit while rolling. Just dust with flour and roll gently.</li>  
<li>The colour of the stuffing may be different based on the type of jaggery you are using. Use light-coloured jaggery if you don’t want a dark colour on your Puran Polis.</li></h3></p>
